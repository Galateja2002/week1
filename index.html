<p></p><b>Ireland</b> <i>(/ˈaɪərlənd/</i> ⓘ IRE-lənd; Irish: Éire <i>[ˈeːɾʲə] ⓘ</i>; Ulster-Scots: Airlann <i>[ˈɑːrlən]</i>) is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe. 
It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel.
<p> Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.[10] 
Geopolitically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), a sovereign state covering five-sixths of the island, 
and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, 
with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.[11]</p>

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The names Ireland and Éire derive from Old Irish Ériu, a goddess in Irish mythology first recorded in the ninth century.</li>
        <li>The etymology of Ériu is disputed but may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *h2uer, referring to flowing water.[17]</li>
