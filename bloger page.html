Exposure therapy is a type of therapy in which you're gradually exposed to the things, situations and activities you fear. There are a few different approaches to this therapy. It can help treat several conditions, like phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder.</p>

I thought I'll keep at it so!. I don't really consider them comedy, I am just being a gobs****. I am doing things I never dreamed of now. I am able to travel to places I never would have been able to go before. I didn't get out much before.”</p>
